# All about data

* Moving Data
* Storing Data
  - access patterns
  - indexing strategies
  - backup solutions
* Transforming Data - 
Taking raw data and turning it into a meaningful information

# CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition Tolerance

Example a banking system should always be consistent and partition tolerant even though comprimising sometimes availability or taking some transactions long.
